## Data Source
A case study from Harvard Business Publishing Education: https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/M347-PDF-ENG

## Background
Star Digital, a multimedia video service provider with an annual advertising budget exceeding $100 million, has been increasingly focusing on online advertising. To assess the effectiveness of their digital display advertising, Star Digital conducted a controlled experiment.

## Business Goal
The primary business goal is to assess the effectiveness of online advertising and measure the causal impact of displaying Star Digital’s advertisements on sales conversions. The specific objectives are if the ads will increase the number of package sales or not. We conducted the A/B testing experiment to run logistic regression test on the Star Digital advertising campaign on six websites.

## Experiment Design
To overcome challenges in measuring digital campaigns, Star Digital implemented a controlled experiment for their marketing campaign. The campaign was executed on six different websites, with the primary goal of boosting subscription sales. The experiment comprised two main treatment variations:

1.Customer Group Split: Star Digital divided its customer base into treatment and control groups, with a 90%-10% split.

Treatment Group: This group will be exposed to Star Digital’s online advertisements.
Control Group: This group will not be exposed to Star Digital’s advertisements.(but charity organiza- tions)

2.Key questions:

Is online advertising effective for Star Digital?
Does the frequency of advertising impact purchase behavior?
Which websites should Star Digital prioritize for advertising, including whether to invest in Site 6 compared to Sites 1 through 5?
